# Deep Learning Exploration with TensorFlow 2

This repository documents my personal learning journey in deep learning and artificial intelligence using TensorFlow 2.

It contains experimental notebooks, custom models, and practical applications of neural networks in areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and generative models.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step implementations
- `reports/` — Summary reports or PDFs
- `assets/` — Images or diagrams used in notebooks
- `requirements.txt` — Dependencies used throughout the project

> All explorations are based on self-study and experimentation.
